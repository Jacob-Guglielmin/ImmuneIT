            "option1": "Nothing.",
            "option2": "Dr. Cook should not have suggested FaceTime because of the security and privacy risks.",
            "option3": "Dr. Cook should have informed Ruth of the privacy risks before using FaceTime.",

            "category": "Privacy",
            "postCorrect": "Well done! Instead, Dr. Cook could have suggested a different secure telehealth platform or asked Ruth if she would like to reschedule an in-person appointment.",
            "postIncorrect": "Incorrect! FaceTime is not approved for telehealth usage. Even if Ruth was aware of the privacy risks, personal information leaks puts the patient at an unnecessary risk, which is a violation of the company’s privacy policy. Instead, Dr. Cook could have suggested another secure application or asked Ruth if she would like to reschedule an in-person appointment."
